# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Ruthwik 
## Mechanical Engineering UG at IIT Madras
I am Ruthwik Chivukula, a third year mechanical engineering undergrad at IIT Madras. I love exploring AI/ML applications in the domains of thermal engineering, specifically fluid dynamics. I am currently learning about computational fluid dynamics and scientific machine learning. Also, acquainting myself with deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and state of the art models. I enjoy expanding my horizons and taking up new challenges. Occasionally draw and paint stuff, a cricket freak and a passionate napper! Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthwik-chivukula-09027123a/)
