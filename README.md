# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Ruthwik 
## Mechanical Engineering UG at IIT Madras
I am Ruthwik Chivukula, a third year mechanical engineering undergrad at IIT Madras. I love exploring AI/ML applications in the domains of thermal engineering, specifically fluid dynamics. I am currently learning about computational fluid dynamics and scientific machine learning. Also, acquainting myself with deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and state of the art models. I enjoy expanding my horizons and taking up new challenges. I enjoy playing chess and occasionally keep myself involved with drawing and painting. Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests!

## Skills and Experience: 
* Pytorch / MATLAB / OpenFOAM / Sklearn / Pandas / Numpy / Figma
* ðŸš€ Team Lead, AI Club, IIT Madras (2023-24)
* ðŸ”§ Mechanical Engineering UG, IIT Madras (2021-2025)

## More about myself
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning scientific ML, Computational Fluid Dynamics, state of the art deep learning models 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Deep Learning projects for CFD 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, we can surely have a fun discussion
