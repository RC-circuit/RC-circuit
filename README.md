# Hi there 👋, I am Ruthwik 
## Ph.D. Candidate at Brown University
I am Ruthwik Chivukula, a first year Ph.D. graduate student at Brown University. I am associated with the CRUNCH Group, Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown, supervised by Prof. George Em Karniadakis. My research interests lie at the interface of deep learning, applied mathematics and fluid dynamics. I am thrilled and excited to build AI augmented numerical frameworks for accelerating PDE solvers to enhance downstream tasks like simulations for engineering use cases. I love taking motivation from cross-domains and apply them into my research, hence even if your interests remotely align with mine, feel free to ping me if you are excited about pushing the frontiers of AI, engineering and science!

## Experience: 
* 🔭 Ph.D. Candidate at Brown University (2025-2030)
* 🚀 Team Lead, AI Club, IIT Madras (2023-2024)
* 🔧 Mechanical Engineering UG, IIT Madras (2021-2025)
