# Hi there 👋, I am Ruthwik 
## Ph.D. Candidate at Brown University
I am Ruthwik Chivukula, a first year Ph.D. graduate student at Brown University. I am associated with the CRUNCH Group, Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown, supervised by Prof. George Em Karniadakis. My research interests lie at the interface of deep learning, applied mathematics and fluid dynamics. I am thrilled and excited to build AI augmented numerical frameworks for accelerating PDE solvers to enhance downstream tasks like simulations for engineering use cases. I love taking motivation from cross-domains and applying them into my research, hence even if your interests remotely align with mine, feel free to ping me if you are excited about pushing the frontiers of AI, engineering and science!

## Experience: 
* 🔭 Ph.D. Candidate, Computational and Applied Mathematics at Brown University (2025-2030)
* 🔬 Research Intern, Computational Data Sciences IISc Bangalore (2023-2025)
* 🏦 Data Analyst Intern, AI Labs American Express (2024)
* 🚀 Team Lead, AI Club, IIT Madras (2023-2024)
* 🔧 Mechanical Engineering UG (Honors) + Minor in Artificial Intelligence, IIT Madras (2021-2025)
